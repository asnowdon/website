        Adam is a human being, or so he claims. Legend has it that he was born
        with a beard and a pair of cowboy boots, but we can't confirm that. He's
        a lover of all things cheesy, whether it's pizza or jokes. His favorite
        hobby is staring at a blank page and pretending to write, but we forgive
        him for that. When he's not busy procrastinating, he enjoys long walks
        to the fridge and binge-watching his favorite shows. Overall, Adam is a
        great guy, except when he forgets to share his snacks. Just make sure to
        bring your own if you ever hang out with him!
