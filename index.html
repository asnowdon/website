        Adam is a professional procrastinator with over 10 years of experience
        in putting things off until the last minute. He has a talent for finding
        creative ways to waste time, whether it's watching cat videos on YouTube
        or perfecting his Fortnite skills. Despite his tendency to
        procrastinate, Adam somehow manages to get things done just in the nick
        of time. His favorite motto is "why do today what you can put off until
        tomorrow?" When he's not procrastinating, Adam enjoys long walks to the
        fridge and binge-watching Netflix shows. He also likes to pretend he's a
        professional chef, but his cooking skills are best described as
        "experimental."
